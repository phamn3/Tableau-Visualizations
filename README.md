# Tableau Visualization Mini Projects

The LinkedIn data science community has really motivated me to brush up on my data visualization skills through this weekly challenge called Makeover Monday. The goal is to essentially revamp a visual that has already been made, using the small datasets given. I am following the creators' __[weekly blog posts](http://www.vizwiz.com/search?q=makeover+monday&by-date=true)__ where the challenges get posted, and I retrieve the datasets from __[this website](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/)__.

Although I am starting the makeovers albeit a year and a half from the challenge's inception, my goal is to slowly build up my savvy Tableau skills and to be able to correctly convey data through visualization. DataViz is super important for concisely displaying data to the end user, and it takes a certain level of creativity and data wrangling/understanding to be able to make an effective visualization that delivers valuable insights. The datasets in these makeovers are maneageable, but have enough difficulty for me to focus on honing different skills in Tableau. It will be a good journey to put myself!
